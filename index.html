  	 <h1>The Learn Enough Story</h1>

  	   <p>
           Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach
           <em>technical sophistication</em>, the seemingly magical ability to take
           command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. This includes
           everything from command lines and coding to guessing keyboard shortcuts,
           Googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing.
           We believe there are <strong>at least a billion people</strong> who can benefit from  learning technical sophistication, probably more. To join our
           movement,

       		HTML was created by the OG web developer, computer scientis <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a>. It is not true that he created the language to share cat photos, but based on the plethora of cats on teh web it is easy to think so.

	 <h3> Founders </h3>

	 	<p>
      		Learn Enough to Be Dangerous was founded in 2015 by Michael Hartl, Lee
      		Donahoe, and Nick Merwin. We believe that the kind of technical
      		sophistication taught by the Learn Enough tutorials can benefit
      		at least a billion people, and probably more.

	 		You may have seen him shredding guitar live with Capital Cities on Kimmy Kimmel, Conan, or The Ellen Show, but rest assured Nisk is a true nerd at heart. He's just as happy shredding well-spec'd lines of code from a tour bus as he is from the kitchen table.
